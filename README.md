# U10793 - Python Fundamentals Course Outline

## Day 1: Introduction to Python Basics

1. **Printing to the Console**: Example demonstrating how to print messages.
2. **Basic Arithmetic**: Example of summing two numbers.
3. **Subtraction Task**: Exercise focused on subtracting two numbers.

## Day 2: Arithmetic Operations

1. **Overview of Arithmetic Operations**: Introduction to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Day 3: User Input and Error Handling

1. **User  Input Validation**: Example of obtaining user input for a number and checking if it's positive, zero, or negative, including error handling for non-numeric input.
2. **Calculator Task**: Create a calculator that performs the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with proper try/except error handling.

## Day 4: Advanced Error Handling and Functions

1. **Weather Input Example**: Collecting and processing weather-related input.
2. **Arithmetic Operations with Error Handling**: Example of performing arithmetic operations with two numbers, incorporating try/except for zero division errors.
3. **Function-Based Calculator**: Develop a calculator using the functions learned in class.

## Day 5: Loops and Iteration

1. **While Loops**: Example demonstrating the use of while loops.
2. **Calculator Using While Loops**: Create a calculator that continuously accepts user input until a specific condition is met.

## Day 6: Conditional Logic and Geometry

1. **Comparison of Values**: Example focusing on classifying triangles (Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene) based on side lengths.
2. **Triangle Type Classification with Loops**: Implement a loop to classify triangles based on user input.

## Day 7: Triangle Operations

1. **Triangle Side Operations**: Add two operators to sum and subtract the sides of a triangle, optionally verifying if the result is positive.

## Day 8: Merging Tasks

1. **Integrate Previous Tasks**: Combine the functionalities of the triangle classification and calculator tasks.

## Day 9: Rectangle Perimeter and Number Analysis

1. **Calculate Rectangle Perimeter**: Formula: perimeter = 2 * (height + width).
2. **Identify the Largest Number**: Determine the largest number from a selection of 3 or 4 numbers using the `max` command.
3. **Identify the Smallest Number**: Find the smallest number within a specified range using the `min` command.

## Day 11: Summation and Average

1. **Summation and Average Calculation**: Adapt the previous task to include options for calculating the sum and average of a list created by the user, ensuring to handle the case where the list is empty.

## Day 12: List Management

1. **List Management Tasks**: Based on the files "Lists_C/_Addition_Task11.ipynb" and "Lists_C__Addition_Removal", add options to find the maximum and minimum numbers in the list.
   - Create a list of 10 integers.
   - Find and print the smallest and largest numbers in the list.
   - Add and remove elements from the list.
   - Print the current list.

## Day 13: Shopping List Management

1. **Create a Shopping List Management System**: Develop a program that allows users to add, list, and remove items from a shopping list.
   - Start the item ID counter at 1, adjusting for correct indexing after removal.
   - Include an option to clear the list.
   - Provide an option to exit the program.

## Day 14: Classes and Inheritance

1. **Class and Subclass Creation**: Based on the file "Introduction_to_Classes.ipynb", think of a different practical case and create a class and a subclass with the respective objects/arguments.
